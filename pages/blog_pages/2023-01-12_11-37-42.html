        <p> <p> Hey everyone! </p>

<br>

<p> Development over Winter break has been crawling; things have come up and Nathan and I haven't been up to par. As of now the project is still alive and we're ready to continue development - we have a *great* plan and a superb roadmap for Turtle Domination. </p>

<br>

<p> In other news, I went down a rabbit hole - when I was younger I briefly worked with a beekeeper for a number of months and lately the urge has struck me to get my own hive. I have enrolled in a local Association's bee school next month and I'm pretty excited! I'll update
 things here when that gets rolling OR I can make my own dedicated blog page. Either way I'll update here somewhere. </p>

 <br>

<br>

<p> University classes start back in about 2 weeks and I hope to have something more tangible finished with the game. Multiplayer will likely be the largest challenge for the next couple weeks; syncing multiple objects together across clients seems like a massive headache and
 I'd like to have that done with the different assets before core game features are implemented. Everything needs to rail on the multiplayer system at the core before we work on anything else. </p>

<br>

<p> This pretty much concludes the post. I just wanted to update everyone, including the blog, because I'm really proud of how this works so far! I'd like to make our blog app a bit more organized and efficient but I need to take things on one at a time. </p>

<br>
<p> Best, <br> Mason </p> </p>
